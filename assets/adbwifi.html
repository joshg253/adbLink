<b><u>ADB over WIFI</b></u><br>

If your device does not support ADB debugging over WIFI you can temporarily activate it with this function.<p>
It requires that you first establish a connection via USB. Once connected, call this menu function to start adbd in tcpip mode, allowing debug connections over wifi.<p>
Once this is done the USB cable can be disconnected and you can connect via the the device IP address.<p>
This will remain enabled until the device is rebooted. After a reboot, you must reconnect using the steps above.<p>
