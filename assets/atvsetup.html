adbLink is tested using the Amazon Fire TV , the Nvidia Shield and the Mi Box 3.
<p>

To allow adbLink to install Kodi the device needs some settings changes and you need the device IP address. The changes below apply to Amazon Fire TV/Stick and Android TV devices.
<p>



<b><u>Amazon Fire TV/Stick</b></u><br>


From the main (Launcher) screen of AFTV, select Settings.
<p>

1. Your IP Address is found under Settings > About > network. Make note of this address.
<p>

2. Select Device > Developer Options.
Turn ADB debugging on.
<p>
For USB connections, turn USB debugging on.
Please note that USB connections disable external storage.
<p>
Turn Apps from unknown sources on. This allows you to install
 non-store applications, e.g. Kodi.
<p>


<b><u>Android TV (Nvidia Shield, Mi Box 3)</b></u><br>

From the main (Launcher) screen, select "Settings".
<p>
Select About
<p>
Scroll down to "Build"
<p>
Click "Build" six or seven times. This will tun on "Developer Options"
<p>
In the "Preferences" section of settings, open "Developer options"
<p>
Turn USB debugging On<br>
Turn Network debugging On (if available)
<p>
Under Settings->Personal->Security, turn "Unknown sources" On.
<p>
Under Settings->Device->Network, make note of your IP address
<p>
Next, connect your device to your PC via the supplied USB cable. A dialog will pop-up on the device asking you to authorize your connection. Confirm the connection and tell the Shield to remember it.
<p>
This initial connection via USB is required. Once you have authorized the USB connection, your connection via IP address will be authorized as well.
<p>
Your device is now ready to accept Kodi installation via adbLink.
<p>
Please explore adbLink's help menu for more information.
