<b><u>Unauthorized Device</u></b><br>
Starting with Android 4.2.x, Google requires that devices
authorize before an adb debugging connection is allowed.
<p>
Typically, this isn't an issue for Amazon Fire TV devices. If
it does occur, try toggling USB Debugging in Developer Options
and deleting/renaming the .android/adbkey and .android/adbkey.pub
files in your $HOME directory. This should force your
device to reauthorize.
<p>
For Android TV devices like the Nvidia Shield:
<p>
Turn on Developer Options in Settings.
<p>
Scroll down to the bottom, or for Android TV to the right of the first row,
and select About tablet.
<p>
Scroll to the bottom of About tablet, to find Build number, and tap the Build
number area repeatedly, until the device says that the developer options have
been unlocked.
<p>
If you get a message that reads, "No need, you are already a developer,"
then this step has already been done.
<p>
Open Developer Options and enable USB Debugging and Network Debugging.
<p>
Connect your device via USB.
<p>
Enable the  "always allow from this computer" checkbox in the dialog
that should pop up.
<p>
If the authorization dialog does not appear, try deleting/renaming the .android/adbkey
and .android/adbkey.pub files in your $HOME directory. This should force your
device to reauthorize.
