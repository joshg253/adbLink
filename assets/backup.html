The <b>"Backup"</b> button backs up the contents of the .kodi/Kodi folder on the device. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this function. Under Android, empty directories are not backed up.
Android users running something other than <a href=kodi.html>Kodi</a> such as the SPMC fork, will need to change the package name amd File Path
in the <a href=preferences.html>Device Setup</a> dialog to whatever package name and File Path your software uses.
<p>

Android: Choose your Kodi partition:
/sdcard/ is the default partition for Android Kodi data. If you have <a href="mvdata.html">moved data</a>, adbLink displays all system-approved external partitions, select the external partition where the data resides.
<p>
Other OS Versions: adbLink will attempt to back up the default Kodi data location for your operating system. The default can be changed in the device <a href=preferences.html>preferences</a> dialog.
<p>
Addons: adbLink is tested with official Kodi repository addons only. If you have issues backing up a non-repository addon, write jocala@jocala.com with full details.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
