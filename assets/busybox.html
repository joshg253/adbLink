BusyBox: The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux<p>

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. BusyBox provides a fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system.
<p>
adbLink depends on the busybox utility for many of its internal functions on your Android device. This utility function allows you to re-install busybox in the event that it's functioning improperly.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
