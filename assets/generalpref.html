This dialog allows you to specify:<p>
1. Pull directory. A global location where files "pulled" from the selected device go. This can be overridden on the device-level in the device's record. The "Download" button allows you to browse the local filesystem to choose a specific folder, or you may directly enter it into the text field. Default is your home directory.<p>
2. Check for adbLink updates when adbLink starts. The "Check" button immediately checks for adbLink updates.<p>
3. Linux: Check to select the KDE Konsole terminal. Unchecked, the default is the Gnome terminal.<p>

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
