The <b>"Install APK" </b> button installs or "sideloads"  Android apps. Click it and choose the APK file(s) you want installed. All installs are done with the "-r" flag. <p>
This has the effect of preserving a previously installed app's data. It has no effect when installing a new app. If you require a "clean" install of an existing app, uninstall it first.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
