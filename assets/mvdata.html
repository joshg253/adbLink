Android Kodi, by default, stores its data on partition /sdcard/. Unfortunately, on some devices /sdcard/ has limited space, so the <b>"Move Kodi Data"</b> allows you to move your entire Kodi data folder to your device's external storage. Please note that Kodi <u>MUST</u> have been run for the first time before using this dialog.
<p>
The dialog presents a list of your currently mounted external storage and two radio buttons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Move data from /sdcard to selection</li>
<li>Move data from selection to /sdcard/<li>
</ul>

<p>
Select the correct partition, click the radio button of your choice and press "OK".
<p>
The Move data choices move Kodi's entire data folder (.kodi) to the external device selected, or back to the default /sdcard/ partition.<p>
<p>
At start, Kodi looks for a text file "/sdcard/xbmc_env.properties" that tell it where its data files are located. adbLink creates this file when it moves the data directory and deletes the file when you move the directory back to its default.
<p>
Moving data is not allowed if Kodi is running.
<p>
If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
