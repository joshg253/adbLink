<b><u>Non-Android Kodi</b></u>
<p>
Many of adbLink's features are available for Kodi running on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android computers.<p>

<a href="backup.html">Kodi Backup</a><br>
<a href="restore.html">Restore Kodi</a><br>
<a href="console.html">Console</a><br>
<a href="vlog.html">View Logs</a><br>
<a href="editor.html">Edit XML files</a><br>
<a href="splash.html">Splash Screen</a><br>
<a href="remote.html">Push Remote (xml)</a><br>
<p>
The features above, by default, look for the Kodi data to be stored in <a href="kodifolders.html">standard locations</a>,  however you can edit those locations for your situation.
<p>
In order to access a local non-Android device, set up a record for the device, making sure you set the Device OS to a non-Android OS. The device record dialog will set the Kodi file path to the default for this OS:<p>
e.g., "/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Kodi" for the Mac.<p>
<p>
Use the device selection dropdown menu to select a non-Android local device. It does not show up in the "connected devices" listbox.
