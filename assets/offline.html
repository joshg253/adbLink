Device Offline
<p>
If you're not using FireStarter try toggling ADB Debugging off then on in your Fire TV developer settings.
<p>
FireStarter, unfortunately, has been blacklisted by Amazon and is no
longer compatible with adbLink. If you are using a hacked version, it will cause "device "offline", so you will
need to force stop it, then toggle ADB Debugging off/on in your Fire TV developer settings.

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
