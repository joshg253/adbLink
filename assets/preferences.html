<b><u>adbLink Device Record</b></u>
<p>


Other than <a href="atvsetup.html">device settings</a> specific to your system, there is little required for a basic connection between your media device and adbLink.
<p>
If you are connecting your device via a USB cable, pressing "Refresh ADB" after the connection should cause the USB serial number of the device to appear in the "Connected devices" list box. You are now ready to use other adbLink features such as installing Kodi, doing backups, etc.
<p>
If you are connecting your device via IP adress, enter the IP address into the "Ad Hoc IP" text entry field, then press "Connect". The IP address will appear in the "Connected devices" list box. You are now ready to use other adbLink features such as installing Kodi, doing backups, etc.
<p>


You may also create a record for your device. Records allow you to maintain multiple media devices, without the the need to remember their IP addresses, and allow you to reference devices by a descriptive name. Using records you can also specify custom Kodi locations on your system, such as sd cards or usb thumb drives. Device records are optional for Kodi systems, but required for Kodi forks such as SPMC.

<p>
