<b><u>File Manager</u></b><p>
adbLink's file manager is a dual-pane style dialog reminisent of Norton Commander or Midnight Commander. As the name suggests, a dual-pane manager allows the user to open up two separate folders simultaneously and copy/move files and folders from one location into the next. Rename,delete, mkdir, edit and other operations are also supported.<p>
The file manager is "root-aware"; if your device is rooted you can use the FM to do file operations on any partiton you can make read-write.
<p>
If your device is rooted and file manager displays blank panels when launched, your system's "su" utility does not accept parameters passed via the shell, something that adbLink requires.<p>
You can solve this by installing SuperSU by chainfire, available in the Google Play store, and letting it replace the su installed on your system.
<p>
If installing SuperSU isn't possible, you can turn off root functionality by checking the "Disable root" checkbox in the <a href="preferences.html">device record</a>. This will allow File Manager to operate normally on user data areas such as /sdcard.
<p>
<b><u>Known limitations</b></u> <p>
File manager can't edit/copy/rename/delete/browse directories/files whose names contain embedded quotes.
<p>
Additionally, for rooted devices, edit/copy/move/rename/delete are not allowed for files/directories with embedded spaces in names.<p>

If you have directories or files that meet the criteria above, you will have to manipulate them manually using the ADB shell and command-line.
