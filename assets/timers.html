At times, when an Android device enters sleep mode or when the device's
screensaver starts it can have a disruptive effect on Kodi. This dialog allows you to
adjust the timers for sleep and screensaver, even turning the services off so they don't start.
<p>
The dialog shows two sets of controls, for the sleep timer and for the
screensaver timer.<p>

The radio buttons offer choices to turn the timer off or return it to the
default state.<p>

The label below the radio buttons show the timer's current status.<p>

The text entry field allows you to set a custom value in milliseconds for
the timer.<p>

The default values (in milliseconds) for the Amazon Fire TV are:<p>

default sleep:  1200000<br>
sleep off:  0 <br>
<p>
default screensaver:  300000 <br>
screensaver off:  2147460000 <br>
