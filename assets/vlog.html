<b><u>View Log button</b></u> adbLink keeps two logs, one log of your current run and a log of your previous run. They are named adblink.log and adblink.old.log.<p> Using the "View Log" menu option, you can view both these logs and copy them to your clipboard for inclusion in a support post or email. <p> When the Viewer opens it shows by default your current running log, adblink.log. Pressing the "Swap" toggles over to adblink.old.log. Pressing "Swap" again toggles back. <p>Thus you can toggle back and forth between adblink.log and adblink.log.old
<p>

If you have questions or comments, please email jocala@jocala.com or visit one of the forums linked below. adbLink produces a log file, adblink.log, with each run. Include it in your email or post if you're having problems.<p>
